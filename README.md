### Features

BRAILLE is a language vital to all visually impaired individuals and itâ€™s the
only system through which visually impaired people can learn to read and
write, Braille is a system of raised dots that can be read with the fingers by
people who are blind or who have low vision.

So, here I have designed a  Braille keyboard of only 6 keys (as the
whole Braille language consists of only 6 dots). The system takes the
input through Braille keyboard and produces the speech output and they can
also check whether the typed alphabet is correct or not.
